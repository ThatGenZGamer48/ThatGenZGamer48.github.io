            <h2>Introducing myself</h2><br>
            <p>Hey there, I'm Rahul â€“ a tech-savvy and fun-loving individual who's always on the hunt for new
                adventures. I'm a passionate coder, a Rubik's cube enthusiast, and a cricket lover. Music is my
                soul, and I love discovering new artists and genres. But most of all, I cherish the moments I spend with
                my friends, chatting, laughing, and making unforgettable memories. I'm excited to share my journey and
                showcase my skills on this portfolio, so feel free to take a look around and get to know me better.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Me as a YouTuber</h2><br>
            <p>Initially, my YouTube channel focused solely on gaming content. However, as time went by, I began to
                experiment with other types of content. I went through multiple name changes before finally landing on
                the ideal one, GenZ Gamer. It struck the perfect balance between being catchy and informative. At
                present, my channel has a modest following of over one hundred subscribers, but my goal is to reach
                numerous more milestones in the future.</p><br>
            <h2>How I delved into coding</h2><br>
            <p>At first, coding was just a personal hobby driven purely by my curiosity. However, as I delved deeper
                into it, I discovered its boundless potential. My primary coding languages are Python and Javascript,
                but I recently began studying full stack development with React. In my opinion, coding is an enjoyable
                and intuitive activity that I would recommend to anyone.</p>
